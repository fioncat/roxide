[features]
# If your build or runtime environment lacks the openssl dependency, you can enable
# this feature to statically compile openssl into the binary.
# The side effects include an increase in the binary size and a slowdown in the
# compilation speed.
# See: https://docs.rs/openssl/latest/openssl/#vendored
